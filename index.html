    <h1>Flamenco</h1>

    <p>In the U.S. and elsewhere, flamenco is a pervasive marker of Spanish national identity.
        For proof of its currency in pop culture, look no further than Toy Story 3: Buzz Lightyear is mistakenly reset in
        “Spanish mode,” and becomes a passionate Spanish flamenco dancer.
        Indeed, the world outside Spain often stereotypes the nation as inhabited by flamenco dancers, singers, and guitar
        players who are so “passionate,”
        they have little time to engage in the day-to-day world of the mundane.</p>
